This is a hard fork of the laravel-theme package originally developed by Igaster. We've hired Igaster in 2017 as a freelancer to add some new features to original package. After Igaster released new features as version 2.0 we've decided to hard-fork the original package to be able to add more specific features we planned for Laraone CMS.
